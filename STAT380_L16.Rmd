## Front Matter
```{r}
#Remove all objects from Environment
remove(list = ls())

#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart) #For regression and classification trees
library(rattle) #For nice visualization of trees

#Read in Dataset
Toy <- read.csv("L16_Toy.csv")
```

## Example 4

```{r}
model1 <- rpart(y ~ x,
                   method = "anova",
                   data = Toy, minbucket = 3)

fancyRpartPlot(model1, cex =.8)

predict(model1, newdata = Toy, type = "prob")
```
